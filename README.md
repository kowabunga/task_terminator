## Task Terminator Overview:
- - -
Task Terminator is task management application used to manage all of your day-to-day tasks to aide in overall organization. Users will be able to create, edit and terminate all tasks once completed. 

Modern task reminder apps or websites consistently send notifications to your phone. Many users ignore their notifications due to the high volume of alerts and they tend to forget to terminate their tasks. As a result, many tasks are not completed and terminated throughout the day. 

Task Terminator will aide in terminating all tasks created because there will be a direct line of communication and notification to the users phone using a text message and/or email notification. 

If a task needs to be completed the card will be outlined in red until it is ultimately completed. If a task is completed, the card will be outlined in green with a badge stating "Task Complete" at the top right of the task card until it is ultimately terminated. Users will be able to priortize the level of urgency using the numbers 1-3 (1 low urgency and 3 high urgency). A badge will state the level of prioritization at the top right of each task that needs to be completed.
